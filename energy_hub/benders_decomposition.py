"""
Benders decomposition method for two-stage stochastic optimization problems
    Minimize a function F(X) beginning, subject to
	optional linear and nonlinear constraints and variable bounds:
			min  c'*x + sum(p_s*Q_s(x))
			x
			s.t. A*x<=b,
			     Aeq*x==beq,   x \in [lb,ub]
			where Q_s(x)=min q_s'*y
			             y
			             s.t. W_s*y = h_s-T_s*x
			             y \in R^+

notes:
1) The data structure is based on the numpy and scipy
2) This algorithm should be extended for further version to solve the jointed chance constrained stochastic programming
3) In this test algorithm, Mosek is adpoted. https://www.mosek.com/
4) In the second stage optimization, the dual problem is solved.
5) The unbounded ray is obtained using Mosek as well.
