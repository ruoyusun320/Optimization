# Optimization (modelling and algorithm development)
Two parts of work are presented in the optimization package.

1) Modelling
a) Optimal power flow.
b) Economic dispatch.
c) Unit commitment.
d) Chance constrained programming.
e) Two-stage stochastic programming.
f) Two-stage chance constrained programming.
g) Conic programming.
h) Online optimization.
More models will added in the further.

2) Algorithms
a) Interior point method
b) Branch and bound
c) Benders decomposition
d) Generalized Benders decomposition
f) ADMM

Two commercial software packages are required for the deployment of this package, 1) Gurobi and 2) Mosek.

The mathematical models can be found vai the following websites:
